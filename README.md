Restaurant Management System

## Description

In the midst of a pandemic, many restaurants have had to pivot their operations to adapt to the changing needs and preferences of their customers. One such adaptation is the development of a restaurant management system that caters to the needs of a restaurant in the pandemic era.

This restaurant management system is designed to provide a seamless and efficient ordering and booking process for customers, while also ensuring the safety and health of both customers and staff. One of the main features of this system is online food ordering, which allows customers to browse the restaurant's menu, place their orders, and pay online, all from the comfort and safety of their own homes. This helps to minimize physical contact and reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.

Another important feature of the restaurant management system is table booking. This allows customers to reserve tables in advance, ensuring that they can dine at the restaurant at a time that suits them. This feature is particularly important in the pandemic era, as it helps to manage the number of people in the restaurant at any given time, and allows for appropriate physical distancing between tables
